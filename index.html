        <p>Hello! My name is Wenndey Mae Ubatay, and I am from Cagayan de Oro, Philippines. I enjoy
            traveling a lot. I recently went to Taiwan, and I really enjoyed exploring the sights,
            trying delicious foods, and learning about different cultures.

            I am currently studying Web Development, and I’m excited to learn how to create websites
            and bring ideas to life online. I enjoy discovering new technologies and improving my
            coding skills. I hope to combine my love for creativity and problem-solving to build
            engaging and user-friendly websites in the future.
